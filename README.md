## Machine-Learning-Project-2
# Assignment using: 
- Windows 10
- R Studio 0.99
- R 3.2.3

# Tasks:
- Breast Cancer patients dataset
- Classify the tumors as malignant or benign
- Ignore the response variable and perform Clustering techniques to determine explanatory and predictive value
- Perform Principal Component Analysis and re-apply the classifying and clustering algorithms in order to observe potential differences in results


- Steps performed in this project: 

  a) Feature engineering
  
  b) Descriptive Statistics Analysis
  
  c) Missing Values handling
  
  d) Outlier detection
  
  e) Correlation Check
  
  f) Training - Test split dataset using Bootstrap method (70% - 30%)
  
  g) SVM (Radial kernel) Classifier (tune method used to choose optimal cost and gamma values)
  
  h) Random Forests Classifier (No. of variables at each split/mtry:rounded down square root of the number of features of train dataset)
  
  i) Confusion Matrix
  
  j) Model Performance Metrics
  
  k) ROC Curve plot
  
  l) K-Means Clustering (No. of clusters chosen according to Within cluster Sum of Squares plot/'elbow criterion') 
  
  m) Hierarchical Clustering (No. of clusters chosen according to Silhouette values)
  
  n) Principal Component Analysis 
  
  o) several visualizations (Random Forest Variable Importance plot, Principal Components Scree plot, BiPlot PCA, descriptives plots, etc.)
